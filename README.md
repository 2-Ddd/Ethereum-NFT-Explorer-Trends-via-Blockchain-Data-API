# Ethereum NFT Explorer: Trends via Blockchain Data API 

You can find the complete guide on the Dune blog [here](https://dune.com/blog/complete-guide-analyzing-the-top-10-ethereum-nfts-using-dune-api).

The guide demonstrates how to use Dune Analytics to analyze Ethereum NFT trading volumes with custom SQL queries. It walks through setting up Python dependencies, creating a Dune query, and using the Dune API to retrieve and visualize the data with libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib. The SQL query focuses on the nft.trades table, pulling data on NFT collections and sales volumes, which are then visualized in charts.

You can find the sql query that this script runs in `SQL QUERY/query_sql.sql` file.

The flowchart below outlines the process of the Python script designed to retrieve and display Ethereum NFT data from Dune, starting from loading the API key to graphing the trading volumes.
